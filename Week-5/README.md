### HW for next class (finish before 3/7/16 @ 6:30pm)

Finish your projects!

**Description:** Build an application/implementation/artwork (physical or non-physical) that harnesses brain, muscle, and/or heart activity in some fashion. It could be a game, a biofeedback application, a neuro-powered robot or machine, etc. This project is very open-ended, so be sure to hone in on something early on; biosensing is harder than you think, so be sure not to bite off more than you can chew (I'll do my best to help contain enthusiasm). You'll be working in groups, and I'll do my best to make sure the groups are balanced with respect to technical/design/documentation proficiencies. All three are equally important for this project.

**Groups:** 4 people per group. You will have the same group for the duration of the course. If you run into group dynamic problems, please come to me.

**Requirements:** You must document your work thoroughly, and publish it online. If you have an issue with this (as a result of IP concerns), discuss with me.
Your project's code must end up on Github (or a similar code-sharing platform) w/ a thorough readme.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
[25%] Technical Achievement
[25%] Creativity/Novelty
[25%] Design & Aesthetics
[25%] Documentation
